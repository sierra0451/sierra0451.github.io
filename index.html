    I see you like poking around. Well, personally, I don't think there's much to see here, but if you're really THAT interested in the inner skeleton of my little website, I suppose I can't stop you digging. Have fun!

                Hi, I'm Sierra0451! Or just Sierra for short. I'm some random girl who's just kinda vibing on my own little corner of the internet. You might find me around every now and then in various places, though I'm by far most active publicly on Tumblr. I also have a Discord that I'm pretty active on, but I'd rather only give that to close friends.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you find one of my Blender renders out in the wild that you wanna use as a pfp, feel free to do so! Just be sure to credit me. Don't go reposting around random places, though; I'd highly encourage you to <a href="http://www.wheatonslaw.com/" target="_blank">follow Wheaton's Law</a>.
            </p>

                A little more about me? Well&hellip; I'm an amateur programmer, composer, and writer who wants to make a video game of her own one day. Not much more to it, I'm afraid. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
